# Frontend

This is a collection of tips and links related to modern frontend engineering.
The collection is maintained in a single [org-file](https://orgmode.org), so if
you are a regular user of emacs and org-mode, you can use it as a todo-list as
well.

The collection is a living document, updated about once a week and mostly
contains references, and only little content. This is intentional: as an
engineer these days, you are expected to be able to look up information, whether
given hint is coarse or fine. I wish you good luck on this journey, and
remember: the best thing you can do for tomorrow's yourself is learn something
today.

So please [proceed to the collection](./LIBRARY.org). Cheers!
